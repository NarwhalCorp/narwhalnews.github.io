    While you sail along the Arctic waters of Canada, you are enjoying the beautiful view.
    The Sun is at its peak, and the water is clear until the horizon.
    You hope to see a couple of humpback whales breaching, but then your tour guide reminds you that humpbacks do not live here.
    He says that something much, much better thrives in these waters.
    You ponder of what such creature it could be, and then you see it. 
    A horn, rather called a tusk, rises above the tides. 
    <br>You ask your tour guide, "I thought unicorns were fake! And now they live underwater?!"
    <br>Your tour guide says, "Not just any unicorn. They're unicorns <em>of the sea</em>."
    By now the wonderful creature as fully risen, and you can see it clearly. 
    This mammal, known as a narwhal, leaves you mystified.
    <br>
    The narwhal, scientific name: Monodon Monoceros [well, that's a mouthful], is a carnivorous marine mammal.
    It's family is: another mouthful. Just kidding. This fabulous creature is part of the family Monodontidae.
    The Monodon Monoceros shares its family with the beluga whale.
    <br>
    A narwhal can grow from 13 to 20 feet long, and weighs about 1.5 tons (3,000 lbs)! 
    The <em> unicorns of the sea </em> have lifespans from 30 to 50 years. 
    As mentioned above, the narwhal is a carnivore.
    It is a toothed whale, and its diet can consist of squid, shrimp, fish, and crab. 
    These animals create a kind of vacuum to suck up food. Slurp!

   <h2 class="hright"> The Mysterious Horn </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="right">
        You might have already known this, but a narwhal's horn is not a horn. It's actually a tooth.
    These magnificent beasts only have two teeth. For males, the more prominent tooth grows into a long, lance-like tusk that spirals.
    The tooth grows through the narwhal's top lip, making it look like a horn. The tusk is not just a tooth, however. 
    It is filled with nerves and small holes which allow water to enter. It is believed that the tusk allows the narwhal to sense
    when its environment alters. Females might also grow a small "horn."
